### <center> Project at a glance 
>In this project, we have used a real dataset of membrane proteins with five different classifications(Labels). The Initial dataset consists of 2059 and 2625 (train and test dataset) membrane proteins' amino acids sequences. We concatenated the test and train dataset and generated 4684 membrane protein sequences. Since protein sequences are just a series of alphabets (amino acid abbreviations), we implemented several procedures described below.
><br>The critical point is that we implemented this project from scratch, and we did not copy any part from other works. This work was presented at the 10th international Bioinformatics conference in 2022 under Parham Hajishafiezahramini's name(First Author) (https://icb10.ut.ac.ir/paper?manu=43325).
In this project, we decided to use the same dataset and apply all the project's tasks. We added a lot of descriptions about all the data columns, how we achieved and extracted them, how we checked the outliers, how we added the missing outliers manually, how we handled the outliers and missing values, and prepared clean data.
